An exact definition of “big data” is difficult to nail down because projects, vendors, practitioners, and business professionals use it quite differently. thereupon in mind, generally speaking, big data is:

large datasets
the category of computing strategies and technologies that are wont to handle large datasets
In this context, “large dataset” means a dataset overlarge to reasonably process or store with traditional tooling or on one computer. this implies that the common scale of huge datasets is consistently shifting and should vary significantly from organization to organization.
